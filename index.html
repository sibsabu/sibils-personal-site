    <p>
        I was born in a <u> small town in India </u>
        When I was young my parents, who are both nurses, made a big sacrifice and moved
        to the United Kingdom to give me
        and my <u> little brother </u> a <u> better education </u> and a better chance in life.
        When I arrived in England, I could barely speak English.
        My teachers and my parents didnâ€™t give up on me
        and I managed to not only learn, but grow as an individual.
        I still have a lot of growing to do but I am thankful for their belief in me.
        Right now, with their help and the help of <u> my friends </u>,
        I managed to get an <u> internship with Boeing </u>, which is where I am now.

                            Right now, I am an intern at Boeing Defence UK (BDUK),
                            a subsidiary of the Boeing Company.

                        <p>
                            I joined BDUK because my interview was very candid and eye-opening
                            it made me want to work here because of how honest everyone was.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During this placement I have managed to implement an automated stakeholder
                            analysis tool, something that I am really proud of.

                            In my second year,
                            I became the Vice President of Marketing at
                            Lancaster University Investment Finance Society (LUIFS).

                            The Big Short was one of the reasons I joined. I watched that
                            film 4 times and I still didn't fully understand it.I needed
                            to know how the global financial systems worked, so that's why I joined.

                            It was a steep learning curve, but I feel so much more aware of how
                            markets work now.
