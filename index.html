        I was born <u> in India. </u>
        When I was young, my parents made a big sacrifice and moved
        to the United Kingdom.
        My <u> brother was born </u> a little after that.
        Since then I have managed to make <u>great friends</u>, experience <u> amazing things </u> and
        right now,
        I am doing an <u> internship with Boeing! </u>

                            Currently, I am an intern at Boeing Defence UK (BDUK),
                            a subsidiary of the Boeing Company.

                            Culture is a word that's often mentioned in business.
                            I really like my teams culture. One of my colleagues described it
                            as a place where people are encouraged to try and where
                            they are not afraid of failing in front of others.
                            I joined BDUK because I had an eye-opening interview with my manager,
                            it made me realise that i would fit in here.

                            During this placement I have managed to implement an automated stakeholder
                            analysis tool, something that I am really proud of.

                            In my second year,
                            I became the Vice President of Marketing at
                            Lancaster University Investment Finance Society (LUIFS).
                            This was such an enjoyable time.

                        <p>
                            The Big Short was one of the reasons I joined. After watching that
                            film 4 times I realised how little I knew. So I joined to learn a bit more
                            about how the global financial systems worked.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was a steep learning curve, but I feel a bit more aware of how
                            markets work now.
