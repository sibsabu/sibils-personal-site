        Every HTML element is a member of one or more content categories â€” these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules, especially when you come upon their intricate details. It's also possible for elements to not be a member of any of these categories.

             I'm currently an intern at Boeing Defence UK, a subsidiary of the Boeing company
I realise I like helping teams do things better and more efficiently during this internship.
I also realised I am not too shabby at Excel, I created an automated stakeholder analysis matrix for my team and I helped create a sales pipeline timeline with my colleague, Greg.

                In my second year at uni I became the vice president of marketing at Lancaster university investment finance society.
I applied for this role after watching the big short, in fact the big short was the main reason I decided to specialise in economics with my degree.
I helped my team create our very first Instagram page, coordinated a joint social with the fashion society and ran an advertising campaign on billboards campus!
