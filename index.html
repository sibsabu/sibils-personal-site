<section id="about-me" class="page-one-child padding">
    <p>
        I was born in a <u> small town in India </u>
        When I was young my parents, who are both nurses, made a big sacrifice and moved
        to the United Kingdom to give me
        and my <u> little brother </u> a <u> better education </u> and a better chance in life.
        When I arrived in England, I could barely speak English.
        My teachers and my parents didnâ€™t give up on me
        and I managed to not only learn, but grow as an individual.
        I still have a lot of growing to do but I am thankful for their belief in me.
        Right now, with their help and the help of <u> my friends </u>,
        I managed to get an <u> internship with Boeing </u>, which is where I am now.

                            Im currently an intern at Boeing defence uk,
                            a subsidiary of the boeing company

                            I realise I like helping teams do things better
                            and more efficiently during this internship.

                            I also realised I am not too shabby at Excel,
                            I created an automated stakeholder analysis matrix for my team
                            and I helped create a sales pipeline timeline with my colleague, greg.

                            In my second year at uni I became the vice president of marketing
                            at Lancaster university investment finance society.

                        <p>
                            I applied for this role after watching the big short,
                            in fact the big short was the main reason
                            I decided to specialise in economics with my degree.

                            I helped my team create our very first Instagram page,
                            coordinated a joint social with the fashion society
                            and ran an advertising campaign on billboards campus!
